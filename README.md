# Wireframing
In most cases, as a frontend developer in software development, you will receive a complete set of mockup designs from the UI/UX design team. These designs are usually well thought out, providing you with an idea of what the end product will look like and all the assets you will need for implementing the UI.

There are several wireframing tools available, most of which use the same underlying concepts. Figma is a great tool. Letâ€™s take a moment to understand some wireframing basics.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
- **Layout Structure:** Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
- **Navigation:** Shows how users will move through the site or application.
- **Content Placement:** Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
- **Functionality:** Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

## Difference Between Low-fidelity and High-fidelity Wireframes
- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes:** Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
- **High-Fidelity Wireframes:** More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.
